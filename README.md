Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal website repository. This site is where I showcase my projects, share my thoughts, and connect with fellow developers and enthusiasts. Whether you stumbled upon this by chance or intentionally found your way here, I'm thrilled to have you!ðŸ’¯

## About me

I'm PG Openda, a passionate software engineer with a love for crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. I have major interests in artificial intelligence and the blockchain, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies.

## Features

- **React:** This website is built using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows me to create dynamic and interactive experiences for visitors.
- **Vite:** I've leveraged Vite to optimize the development and build process. With its fast build times and hot module replacement, Vite ensures a smooth development experience.
- **Bootstrap:** Bootstrap provides a solid foundation for the design and layout of the website. I specifically leveraged its free icons.
